# Reason for applying for a job  
I study technical task attentively, considering several ways of solving problems, which may arise. As you know, juniors are assigned to perform simple tasks. I’m extremely detail-oriented when performing all the tasks ( even if they are routine). However, I am not afraid of difficult problems, I try to understand problems using knowledge, which I got on courses and using different internet resources. I would like to develop my web - development skills and position junior is a great chance for that.
